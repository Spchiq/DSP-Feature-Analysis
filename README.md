This is the entire code used for the DSP Feature Analysis Project.

For MATLAB implementation you will need to download the dataset from the html file and move it into the CIFAR-10 folder.
You will also need to install the Machine Learning toolbox and the respective ML models add-ons if you want to use a 
pretrained model like I did.

Python notebook was written on Google Colab which can download the dataset directly, if you open the notebook in another
IDE some changes might be necessary. Google Colab code is also using tensorflow to connect to the GPUs provided.
